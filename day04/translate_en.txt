I am happy
I am happy
I am happy
I'm really happy
Today the day is coming. It's a pleasant day
Let's open the stuffy chest that has shrunk
Light clothes and friendly friends and pleasant hearts
Singing around the mountains and the mountains, we all together
I am happy
I am happy
I am happy
I'm really happy
Summer is coming back after spring when azalea blooms
It's our summer where there is a pouring sun youth
There is our dream in the river and the mountains.
I sing a song there, all of us are all together
I am happy
I am happy
I am happy
I'm really happy
